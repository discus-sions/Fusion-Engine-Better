}

//thats most you'll porbably use. the rest are vars like you can make a Character on here.
//One important thing to note is modchartStorage. It can be accessed by PlayState.instance.modchartStorage. It houses all vars for hscript since vars in hscript are wack lol.

//example:

//var dad2 = new Character(x, y, 'scabe')
//dad2.animation.play('idle');
